    <h1>How can I start to design my website?</h1>
    <p>
        This article covers all-important first step of every project: define what you want to accomplish with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our objective is to learn to define goals to give directions to your web project.
    </p>



    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side.
        <br>
        <br>
        Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is <em>what you want to accomplish.</em>
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from lack of technical know-how, but from lack of goals and vision.
        <br><br>
        So when you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>What exactly do I want to accomplish?</li>
            <li>How will a website help me reach my goals?</li>
            <li>What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            All of this is called <em>project identation</em> and is a neccessary first step to reach your goal, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h2>Active learning</h2>
    <p><em>
        There is no active learning yet. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Getting_started">Please, consider contributing</a>.
    </em></p>
    
    
    
    <h2>Deeper dive</h2>
    <p>
        A project never starts with the technical side.
        <br><br>
        Musicians will never make any music unless they first have an idea of what they want to play&#8212;and the same is true for painters, writers, and web develpers.
        <br><br>
        Technique comes second.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technique is obviously critical.
        <br><br>
        Musicians must master their instrument.
        <br><br>
        But good musicians can never produce good music without an idea.
        <br><br>
        Therefore, before jumping into the technical side &#8212; for example, code and tools&#8212;you must first step back and decide in detail what you want to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        An hour's discussion with friends is a good start, but indiquate.
        <br><br>
        You must set down and structure your ideas to get a clear view of what path you must take to make your ideas a reality.
        <br><br>
        To do this, you need only pen and paper and some time to answer at least the following questions.
        <br><br>
        <div class="note">
            There are countless ways to carry out a project ideation.
            <br><br>
            We cannot lay them all out here (a whole book wouldn't be enough).
            <br><br>
            What we will present here is a simple method to handle what professors call Project Ideation, Project Planning, and Project Management.
        </div>
    </p>
    


    <h3>What exactly do I want to accomplish?</h3>
    <p>
        This is the most important question to answer, since it drives everything else.
        <br><br>
        List all the goals you want to reach.
        <br><br>
        It can be anyhting: selling goods to make money, expressing political opinions, meeting new friends, gigging with musicians, collecting cat pictures, or whatever 
        you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose you are a musician.
        <br><br>
        You could wish to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Let people hear your music.</li>
        <li>Sell goodies.</li>
        <li>Meet other musicians.</li>
        <li>Talk about your music.</li>
        <li>Teach music through videos.</li>
        <li>Publish photos of your cats.</li>
        <li>Find a new girl/boyfriend.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once you have such a list, you need to prioritize.
        <br><br>
        Order the goals from most important to least important:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a new girl/boyfriend.</li>
        <li>Let people hear your music.</li>
        <li>Talk about your music.</li>
        <li>Meet other musicians.</li>
        <li>Sell goodies.</li>
        <li>Teach music through videos.</li>
        <li>Publish photos of your cat.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Doing this simple exercise&#8212;writing goals and sorting them&#8212;will help you out when you have decisions to make. (Should I implement these features, use
        these services, creating these designs?)
    </p>
    <p>
        So now that you have a prioritized list of goals, let's move on to the next question.
    </p>

    <h3>How could a website bring me to my goals?</h3>
    <p>
        So you have a list of goals and you feel you need a website to reach those goals.
        <br><br>
        Are you sure?
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's look back at our example.
        <br><br>
        We have five goals connected to music, one goal related to personal life (finding your significant other), and the completely unrelated cat photos.
        <br><br>
        Is it reasonable to build a single website to cover all those goals?
        <br><br>
        Is it even neccessary?
        <br><br>
        After all, scores of existing web services might bring you goals without building a new website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finding a girl/boyfriend is a prime case where it makes more sense to use existing resources rather than build a whole new site.
        <br><br>
        Why?
        <br><br>
        Because we'll spend more time building and maintaining the website rather than actually searching for a girl/boyfriend.
        <br><br>
        Since our goals is what matter most, we should spend our energy leveraging existing tools rather than starting from scratch.
        <br><br>
        Again, there are so many web services already available for showcasing photos that it isn't worth the effort to build a new site just to spread the word about how 
        cute our cats are.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other five goals are all connected to music.
        <br><br>
        There are, of course, many web services that can handle these goals, but it makes sense in this case to build a dedicated browser of our own.
        <br><br>
        Such a website is the best way to <em>aggregate</em> all the stuff we want to publish in a single place (good for goals 3, 5, and 6) and promote 
        <em>interaction</em> between us and the public (good for goals 2 and 4).
        <br><br>
        In short, since these goals all revolve around the same topic. having everything in one place will help us meet our goals and help our followers connect with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        How can a website help me reach my goals?
        <br><br>
        By answering that, you'll find the best way to reach your goals and save yourself from wasted offer.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?</h3>
    <p>
        Now that you know what you want to accomplish, it's time to turn those goals into actionable steps.
        <br><br>
        As a side note, your goals are not neccessarily set in stone.
        <br><br>
        They evolve over time even in the course of the project, especially if you run across unexpected obstacles or just change your mind.
        <br><br>
        Rather than go through a long explanation, let's go back to our example with this table:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Goals</th>
            <th>Things to do</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Let people hear your music</td>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Record music</li>
                    <li>Prepare some audio files usable online (Could you do this with existing web services?)</li>
                    <li>Give people access to your music on some part of your website</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Talk about your music</td>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write a few articles to start the discussion</li>
                    <li>Define how articles should look</li>
                    <li>Publish those articles on the website (How to do this?)</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Meet other musicians</td>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Provide ways for people to contact you? (Email? Facebook? Phone? Mail?)</li>
                    <li>Define how people will find those channels from your website</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sell goodies</td>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create the goodies</li>
                    <li>Store the goodies</li>
                    <li>Find a way to handle shipping</li>
                    <li>Find a way to handle payment</li>
                    <li>Make a mechanism on your site for people to place orders</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Teach music through videos</td>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Record video lessons</li>
                    <li>Prepare video files viewable online (Again, could you do this with existing web services?)</li>
                    <li>Give people access to your videos on some part of your website</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Two things to notice.
        <br><br>
        First, some of these items are not web-related (e.g., record music, write articles).
        <br><br>
        Often those offline activities matter even more than the web side of the project.
        <br><br>
        In sales, for instance, it's far more important and time-consuming to handle supply, payment, and shipment than to build a website where people can place orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, setting out actionable steps lead to new questions you will need to answer.
        <br><br>
        Usually there turn out to be more questions than we originally tought. (For example, should I learn how to do all this myself, ask someone to do it for me, or use
        third-party services?)
